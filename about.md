##### Experience
I have been developing software professionally for three years. I started my
professional career at [Bixly](https://www.bixly.com/) developing web applications
using Django and Angular. After a couple years at Bixly I moved to Washington DC
to continue my career at Boeing where I have been developing backend services
utilizing primarily Java. Although, for the past few months I have been developing
in primarily ES6 which has been an absolute blast.

##### Projects
At this point in my career all of my projects are proprietary. Although, I can
talk about some of the technologies I have used from industry to build these
various projects.

##### Interests
I enjoy talking about Agile software development life cycles such as scrum. In
conjunction with that, I will talk your ear off about how much I love Redux. I
also spend a lot of time thinking about software design patterns and programming
paradigms like object oriented programming and functional programming. I am currently
teaching myself Clojure so that I know another language on the JVM.
