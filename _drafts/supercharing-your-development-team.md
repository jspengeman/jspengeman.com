In this post I will discuss super charing your development team using practices that will increase productivity, lower risk, and collectively strengthen team members' knowledge portfolios. After having worked professionally as a software engineer for a few years I have learned about a few practices that I feel I could not work effectively without. Over the course of my career I have worked on teams that utilize the processes I will describe as well as teams that do not, so I have the unique opportunity of being able to compare these two different experiences. This comparison allows me to determine what I feel are important practices that every team should be utilizing to super charge their development process. In no way is this an exhaustive list, these are just a few of the practices that I find most valuable for a development team. 

### Peer Reviews
The single most valuable source of growth in my career I think has been provided to me by the peer reviews I have received from my teammates. In conjunction with that, reviewing other developers code is a great way to get exposed to different approaches to solving problems as well as different parts of the code base. Peer reviews are a great way to increase the fluidity of your teams knowledge portfolio. For example, a design pattern one developer uses in a pull request is exposed to multiple reviewers who in turn see the pattern and are given the opportunity to learn the design pattern in the review process. If it is a good pattern they will begin using it themselves in their pull requests which other reviewers will see, I think you are seeing the pattern here.

Although, I believe the main benefit of code reviews is to find issues prior to them being merged to your products baseline. In addition, to that it provides and opportunity to dissect the implementation of a feature or a bug fix. Is the implementation thread safe? Is this code going to run on the *right* thread? What happens if some value is `null`? Is the implementation sufficiently generic enough to support reuse? These are just a few of the questions reviewers should be asking themselves when looking at a code review. The questions will obviously change based on what you are technologies you are working with. Lastly, we all make mistakes. Perhaps you forgot to negate a boolean in an `if` statement or perhaps you used `>` when you meant to use `>=`. We are not perfect these types of mistakes are going to happen. Ideally, we can catch them ourselves prior to doing a code review but if not we know we can rely on our reviewers to help us weed out simple mistakes.  

Peer reviews support a fluidity of knowledge between team members and allow for issues of varying degrees of severity to be caught and discussed prior to integrating into the products baseline. This leads to an increase in the teams knowledge as well as reduced risk when making changes. The team owns the changes being made, not just the individual making the changes.

### Team Mentors
Prior to starting a task I may have an idea of how I am thinking I will implement the solution but I may be unsure of how exactly one piece of the solution may work. In this case I will seek out a teammate that knows the piece of the code base I am going to touch fairly well and go over my solution with them. This teammate ends up mentoring me on the solution and guiding me in the correct direction. Either by telling me why this solution would not work or by assisting in clearing up any issues I have with my suggested solution.

I have been thinking of these teammates as "task mentors" or tech leads for a specific task. Now the person doing the mentoring will change based on what task you are working on but the benefits of having a task mentor are high. From the get go, if you consult with another teammate with regards to the solution you are going to work towards and they sign off on it you will have technical buy in from another teammate who will be able to guide you during the implementation process. In addition to that, they will most likely become a reviewer on your code review since they understand the approach that was being taken better than everyone but yourself. This means if you both agreed on a specific approach to solve a problem that this teammate will be your biggest advocate during the review process.

Instead of working in a vacuum, always seek out a mentor that can mentor you are your current task. This will reduce risk because multiple people will be on board with the approach you are going to take. In the same vein, if you *don't* seek out a mentor on your task, you may end up taking an approach that the team does not agree with resulting in rework needing to be done for the specific task. 

Not every team member will need a "task mentor" but I think developers that are new to a specific team or new to development entirely will benefit from this practice. I often find that I am mentoring one or two people at any given time while being mentored by one or more people at the same time. This results in a team based mentorship where nearly everyone in the team is actively mentoring someone while being mentored themselves. The practice of the team as as a mentor is another practice that will increase the teams knowledge fluidity. Lastly, the best way to learn is by teaching. If you have the opportunity to mentor someone on their solution, take it.  

### Automated Testing
<!-- TODO: What is one other valuable reason? -->
* Increases productivity by being able to more easily make changes.
* Reduces risk by being able to make changes and swap implementations.

### Continuous Integration
<!-- TODO: What is one other valuable reason? -->
* Reduces risk that broken code is ever merged.
* Reduces risk wrt it working on a specific machine.
