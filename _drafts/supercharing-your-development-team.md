In this post I will discuss super charing your development team using practices that will increase productivity, lower risk, and collectively strengthen team members' knowledge portfolios. After having worked professionally as a software engineer for a few years I have learned about a few practices that I feel I could not work effectively without. Over the course of my career I have worked on teams that utilize the processes I will describe as well as teams that do not, so I have the unique opportunity of being able to compare these two different experiences. This comparison allows me to determine what I feel are important practices that every team should be utilizing to super charge their development process. In no way is this an exhaustive list, these are just a few of the practices that I find most valuable for a development team. 

### Peer Reviews
The single most valuable source of growth in my career I think I 
* Increases knowledge about technologies.
* Increases knowledge about parts of the code.
* Reduces risk that bug or defect is merged.

### Team Mentors
<!-- TODO: What is one better valuable reason? -->
* Increase productivity by building camaraderie (reaching?).
* Increases knowledge by learning through teaching.
* Reduces risk by running high level design by mentor.

### Automated Testing
<!-- TODO: What is one other valuable reason? -->
* Increases productivity by being able to more easily make changes.
* Reduces risk by being able to make changes and swap implementations.

### Continuous Integration
<!-- TODO: What is one other valuable reason? -->
* Reduces risk that broken code is ever merged.
* Reduces risk wrt it working on a specific machine.
