      <h5> Experience </h5>
      <p>
        I have been developing software professionally for three years. I
        started my professional career at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.bixly.com/"> Bixly </a> developing web applications
        using Django, Express, and Angular. After a couple years at Bixly I
        moved to Washington DC to continue my career at Boeing where I have been
        developing backend services utilizing primarily Java. Although, I have
        spent a fair amount of time also working in ES6 which has been an
        absolute blast.
      </p>

      <h5> Projects </h5>
      <p>
        At this point in my career all of my projects are proprietary so I can't
        talk to much about the products themselves. Although, I can talk about
        the types of projects I have worked on. I have recently taken some
        ownership at work of a desktop application written in JavaFX. In
        conjunction with that, I am also working on front end web application
        that is built using React and Redux which is super fun to work on. Prior
        to my current job, at Bixly I worked on a variety of different types of
        projects including supply chain management software to social networks
        and even a software system that managed multiple private schools
        administrative tasks such as lunch payments, attendance, and checking
        students in and out of the class room when parents dropped them off or
        picked them off.
      </p>

      <h5> Interests </h5>
      <p>
        I enjoy talking about agile software development life cycles such as
        scrum. In addition to that, I will talk your ear off about how much I
        love Redux. I also spend a lot of time thinking about software design
        patterns and programming paradigms like object oriented programming and
        functional programming. Speaking of functional programming, that has
        become my new favorite hobby over the course of this last year.
